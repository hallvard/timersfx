# timersfx
JavaFX app for timing participants in a competition

The motivation is our internal weekly skiing "competition" at NTNU, but it may be useful for others, too.

In such an event participants gather at one of several arenas in the woods by Trondheim. The person responsible for the event, register the participants and and inform about the track. Usually, the participants set off together and then pass the timer several times before finishing. The participants often pass in groups or close together. Afterwards the timer reports all the times, so people can study how (well) they (and others) did. The app needs to be usable outdoors, often in a cold or wet (snow and/or rain) environemt.
